Agent Communication: FIPA ACL vs MCP

FIPA ACL and MCP represent two different paradigms in agent communication, separated by over two decades of technological evolution. FIPA ACL, standardized in the late 1990s, was designed for autonomous software agents in distributed systems, emphasizing peer-to-peer communication with rich semantic content. MCP, introduced in 2024, focuses on connecting LLM applications to external context sources through a client-server model.

The key architectural difference lies in their communication models. FIPA ACL supports symmetric agent-to-agent messaging where any agent can initiate conversations, propose negotiations, and respond to requests. MCP uses an asymmetric model where servers expose capabilities and clients (LLMs) consume them. FIPA messages carry explicit performatives indicating communicative intent (REQUEST, INFORM, PROPOSE), while MCP uses standard JSON-RPC methods (resources/read, tools/call) without embedded speech acts.

Both protocols address the challenge of interoperability but in different contexts. FIPA ACL enables heterogeneous agents from different vendors to collaborate on complex tasks like supply chain coordination or distributed problem-solving. MCP enables LLM applications to access diverse data sources and tools without custom integration code. While FIPA ACL remains primarily academic, MCP is gaining rapid industry adoption. Interestingly, one could implement FIPA-style agent communication using MCP by exposing FIPA message handling as MCP tools, bridging classical multi-agent systems with modern LLM architectures.
