Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need," revolutionized natural language processing by replacing recurrent neural networks with a purely attention-based mechanism. Transformers process entire sequences in parallel rather than sequentially, enabling efficient training on massive datasets and capturing long-range dependencies that RNNs struggled with.

The core innovation is the self-attention mechanism, which computes relationships between all positions in a sequence simultaneously. Each token attends to all other tokens, learning which parts of the input are most relevant for processing each position. The architecture consists of encoder and decoder stacks, each containing multi-head self-attention layers and feed-forward networks, with residual connections and layer normalization. Positional encodings inject sequence order information since attention itself is permutation-invariant. Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different representation subspaces simultaneously, capturing various linguistic phenomena like syntax, semantics, and coreference.

Transformers form the foundation of modern LLMs including BERT (encoder-only), GPT (decoder-only), and T5 (encoder-decoder). Their parallelizable nature enables training on unprecedented scales, leading to emergent capabilities in few-shot learning, reasoning, and instruction following. Variants like sparse attention, linear attention, and efficient transformers address the quadratic complexity of self-attention for very long sequences. The architecture's success extends beyond NLP to computer vision (Vision Transformers), speech recognition, and multimodal models, making it the dominant paradigm in deep learning.
