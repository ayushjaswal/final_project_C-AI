Dialogue Management

Dialogue management is the component in conversational AI systems responsible for controlling conversation flow, maintaining context, deciding what actions to take, and determining appropriate responses based on conversation state. It serves as the "brain" that orchestrates interactions between intent recognition, entity extraction, business logic, and response generation.

Traditional dialogue managers use finite state machines or frame-based approaches where conversations follow predefined paths with slots to fill. More sophisticated systems employ reinforcement learning, training policies that learn optimal action selection through interaction. Modern LLM-based dialogue managers leverage the model's reasoning capabilities, using conversation history and system prompts to dynamically determine next actions without rigid state machines. Hybrid approaches combine rule-based guardrails for critical paths with flexible LLM-driven handling of open-ended conversation.

Effective dialogue management handles complex scenarios including context switching (user changes topic mid-conversation), error recovery (clarifying misunderstandings), multi-turn information gathering, and graceful degradation when facing unexpected inputs. In task-oriented systems like booking assistants, dialogue managers track slot-filling progress and decide when to confirm, clarify, or execute actions. In open-domain chatbots, they maintain coherence and personality consistency. Key challenges include managing long conversation histories within LLM context limits, balancing initiative between system and user, and ensuring conversations feel natural rather than scripted.
