Intent Recognition

Intent recognition, also called intent classification or intent detection, is the task of identifying the underlying goal or purpose behind a user's utterance in conversational AI systems. It answers the question "what does the user want to accomplish?" and is fundamental to routing conversations, triggering appropriate actions, and providing relevant responses.

Traditional intent recognition systems use supervised machine learning, training classifiers on labeled examples of user utterances mapped to predefined intent categories (e.g., "book_flight", "check_weather", "cancel_order"). Modern approaches leverage transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa fine-tuned on domain-specific data, achieving high accuracy even with limited training examples. These models capture contextual nuances that rule-based or keyword matching systems miss. In production, intent recognition often works alongside entity extraction (NER) to capture both what the user wants and the specific parameters (dates, locations, product names).

Intent recognition quality directly impacts user experience in chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice interfaces. Challenges include handling ambiguous utterances, out-of-scope queries, and multi-intent requests. Advanced systems implement confidence thresholding to trigger clarification dialogs when uncertain, and continuously improve through active learning on production data. With the advent of LLMs, some modern systems use few-shot prompting for intent classification, reducing the need for large labeled datasets while maintaining flexibility to add new intents dynamically.
