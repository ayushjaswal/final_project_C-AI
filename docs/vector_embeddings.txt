Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are dense numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in a high-dimensional space where semantic similarity is captured by geometric proximity. In natural language processing, embeddings transform discrete tokens or sentences into continuous vectors, typically ranging from 128 to 1536 dimensions, where semantically similar items cluster together.

Modern embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, Google's Universal Sentence Encoder, or open-source alternatives like sentence-transformers use deep neural networks trained on massive corpora to learn these representations. The training process optimizes the model to place similar concepts near each other in vector space, measured by metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Unlike traditional one-hot encoding or bag-of-words approaches, embeddings capture nuanced semantic relationships, synonymy, and even analogical reasoning (e.g., king - man + woman ≈ queen).

Vector embeddings are fundamental to modern AI applications including semantic search, recommendation systems, RAG pipelines, and clustering. They enable machines to understand that "automobile" and "car" are similar despite having no character overlap, or that "Paris is to France" has a similar relationship to "Tokyo is to Japan." The quality of embeddings directly impacts downstream task performance, making the choice of embedding model critical for applications like conversational AI where understanding user intent is paramount.
