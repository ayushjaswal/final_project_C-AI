Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values, and domain-specific entities. NER extracts structured information from unstructured text, enabling machines to understand "who," "what," "where," and "when" in user utterances.

Modern NER systems predominantly use sequence labeling approaches with transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or domain-specific variants, fine-tuned on annotated corpora using schemes like BIO (Begin-Inside-Outside) or BILOU tagging. These models consider contextual information bidirectionally, resolving ambiguities that simpler approaches miss (e.g., distinguishing "Apple" the company from "apple" the fruit). Advanced implementations incorporate entity linking, connecting recognized entities to knowledge bases like Wikipedia or domain ontologies for disambiguation and enrichment.

In conversational AI, NER works in tandem with intent recognition to extract actionable parameters from user requests. For example, in "Book a flight to Paris next Friday," NER identifies "Paris" as a location and "next Friday" as a date, while intent recognition determines the booking action. Challenges include handling novel entities not seen during training, nested entities, and entity boundary detection in informal conversational text with typos or abbreviations. Production systems often combine pre-trained models with custom entity types and post-processing rules for domain-specific accuracy.
